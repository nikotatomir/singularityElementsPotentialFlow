These jupyter notebooks give the results of singularity elements (in 2D) that form the basis for aerodynamic modeling using potential flows. 
The formulae are taken from Katz & Plotkin in Chapter 10, pg. 230 [1].

The singularity elements considered in these jupyter notebooks are the following:
	1. constant strength source
	2. constant strength vortex
	3. constant strength doublet
	4. linear strength source
	5. linear strength doublet
